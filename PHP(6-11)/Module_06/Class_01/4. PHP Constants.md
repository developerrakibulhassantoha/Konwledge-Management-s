### PHP, constants are like variables but with a significant difference: their values cannot be changed after they are defined. Constants are used to store values that should remain the same throughout your PHP script

- [ ] **Defining Constants:** Constants are defined using the define() function or the const keyword. The define() function is typically used for defining global constants, while the const keyword is used for class constants.


```php
// Using define() for global constants 
define("SITE_NAME", "My Website"); 
define("MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS", 3);

// Using const for class constants 
class MathConstants { 
const PI = 3.14159265359; 
}
```

**Accessing Constants: You can access constants in the same way you access variables, but without the dollar sign ($) before the constant name**

```php
echo SITE_NAME; // Outputs: My Website 
echo MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS; // Outputs: 3 
echo MathConstants::PI; // Outputs: 3.14159265359
```


# PHP Comments:

PHP, comments are used to annotate your code with explanatory text that is not executed as part of the program. Comments are ignored by the PHP interpreter and are solely for human readers to understand and document the code. PHP supports two types of comments: single-line comments and multi-line comments.

**Single-Line Comments**: Single-line comments are used for adding comments on a single line. They begin with a double forward slash ( // ) and continue until the end of the line.

```
// This is a single-line comment
```

## Multi-Line Comments:

```
/* 
This is a multi-line comment. 

It can span multiple lines. 
*/
```
