### In PHP, the ==sprintf function== is used to format a string according to a specified format and returns the formatted string. It is similar to the printf function, but instead of printing the formatted string, sprintf allows you to store the formatted result in a variable or use it in further operations

```php
$name = "Alice"; 

$age = 25; 

$formattedString = sprintf("Name: %s, Age: %d", $name, $age); 

echo $formattedString;

```
