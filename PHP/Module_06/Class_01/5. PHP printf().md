PHP, the ==printf function== is used for formatted output. It allows you to print formatted strings with placeholders that can be replaced by values.

```php
$name = "Alice"; 
$age = 25; 
printf("Name: %s, Age: %d", $name, $age);
```

Here %s is a placeholder for a string, and %d is a placeholder for an integer. The printf function replaces these placeholders with the values of $name and $age ,

# PHP printf() placeholders:

%s is used for inserting strings into the formatted output:
```php
$name = "Alice"; 
printf("Name: %s", $name);
```

%d or %i is used for inserting signed decimal integers into the formatted output:
```php
$age = 25; 
printf("Age: %d", $age);
```

%f is used for inserting floating-point (decimal) numbers into the formatted output:
```php
$price = 19.99; 
printf("Price: %.2f", $price);
```


%x is used for inserting lowercase hexadecimal numbers into the formatted output:
```php
$hexValue = 255; 
printf("Hex Value: %x", $hexValue);
```

%X - Uppercase Hexadecimal Number:
```php
$hexValue = 255; 
printf("Hex Value: %X", $hexValue);
```
